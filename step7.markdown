## Machine Learning

---

Some of you may say "Why don't you talk about machine learning earlier?", "Machine learning, what is that?" ,etc.
First, machine learning is not necessary even to reach top elite division.
Second, machine learning is very hard, and you will need to know everything explained in previous step.

Machine Learning is very strong, there's multiple examples where machine learning are the best. You can google "AlphaGo, AlphaZero or AlphaStar" to see that machine learning  can "kcik ass".

I suggest to try machine learning, if you want to:
1. Do a lot of reasearch and coding.
1. Have a lot of time, to train your snake
1. Deep knowledge for machine learning
1. Have access to GPU power to train your snake

I won't go much deeper in machine learning, because I'm not an expert on that subject and Cory did a amazing [Blog post about it](https://medium.com/asymptoticlabs/battlesnake-post-mortem-a5917f9a3428)
