## Improving your snake

To improve your snake, first you need to know why it lost some games. Looking at several games, you will probably see a pattern how your snake lost. Second, you need to find a way to prevent this kind of lost, it could be as simple as avoid being near wall, or stay away from bigger snake, etc.

To test your snake in a particular situation, you can use the [Board Generator](https://Nettogrof.github.io/battle-snake-board-generator/). The board generator, let you create manually a position that you can "send it" to your snake and see its response.

Example, my snake "Nessegrev" will go in a dead-end, if there a food in it. I could program a function to avoid dead-end, then re-create a dead-end situation with the board generator, and check if my new function works correctly or not, without having to play/check several game.

Once done, you can repeat this step several times to improve your snake each time with different mistakes your snake made. 

At this point, you should see your snake rating increasing, you may even join some tournament/league in Rookie division. Don't forget that even in Rookie division some snake are very strong. 

Have fun with others during tournament, twitch chat are a great way to known others developpers.
