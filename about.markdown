## About me, known as Nettogrof & Nessegrev

I started to play on a 8086 computer. I learn my alphabet with a keyboard; before learning how to write words, I was using DOS. So yep I'm that old. 
Since that, I'm always passionated by computer. I had studied in IT, and I work for an IT company.

My first IT jobs, was a "production support" meaning my job was to be sure that all servers/application under my responsability were up and running. At that job I learn a lot about software developement and the importance of each step of the process.
After that, I started to be interest in AI/bot engine several years ago. I did some chess engine for fun as an hobby.
