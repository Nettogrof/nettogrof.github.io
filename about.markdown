## About this website

This website is a bunch of blog post made by me about [Battlesnake](https://play.battlesnake.com)

## Who am I 

I'm known as Nettogrof / Nessegrev on [Battlesnake](https://play.battlesnake.com), [Twitch.tv](https://www.twitch.tv/nessegrev) and on Battlesnake Developer Community on [Slack](https://play.battlesnake.com/slack) and [Discord](https://play.battlesnake.com/discord).

### IT Background

I started to play on a 8086 computer. I learn my alphabet with a keyboard; before learning how to write words, I was using DOS. So yep I'm that old. 
Since that, I'm always passionated by computer. I had studied in IT, and I work for an IT company.

My first IT jobs, was a "production support" meaning my job was to be sure that all servers/application under my responsability were up and running. At that job I learn a lot about software developement and the importance of each step of the process.
After that, I started to be interest in AI/bot engine several years ago. I did some chess engine for fun as an hobby. 

Since then, I changed several time jobs being:  Front-End developper, Business Analyst, QA Tester, Production Analyst and Team Lead.
My current job is Subject Matter Expert (SME) Application Support.

### Battlesnake Background

I joined Battlesnake on Feb. 21, 2020, because I like all AI/bot engines and it easy to join and create a snake.
My first competition was the [Stay Home and Code](https://play.battlesnake.com/competitions/stay-home-and-code/), my snake did poorly, but I wasn't surprise, I was already working on a better snake.
My second competition [Communitech](https://play.battlesnake.com/competitions/communitech/) went better, my snake reached the top 8. With that result, I decide to stop compete in Rookie division, to switch to Veteran.
